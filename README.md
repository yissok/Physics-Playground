# Physics-Playground
Physics engine used was produced by William Bittle (ENGINE: http://www.dyn4j.org/ GIT: https://github.com/wnbittle)

This project was more of a playground so I did not package it up nicely... to interact with the project you can:
1) import it as an intellij project
2) just open up the jar file under out>artifacts>physicsPlayground_jar
3) get all the classes yourself and build the project with the default java compiler
